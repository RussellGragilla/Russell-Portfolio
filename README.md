The CSV contents in this repository are all about agricultural data. All csv data comes from https://ourworldindata.org/. 
All of the CSV files are joined data, of individual tables. For example, the agriculture_fruits data is a combination of tables featuring apple production, orange production, pear production, etc.
This was continued for all the data to consolidate everything into easier to navigate groupings. All of this was done on MySQL Workbench.
This data was used to examine trends in agriculture, as demonstrated by the exploratory python coding down in the IPYNB file in this repository.
There is also an associated Tableau dashboard that goes with this data, that was published on Tableaus public sharing data website.

There is also an xlsx (Excel) file in this repository, which loads up a dashboard created in Excel, that examines trends among Fortune 500 companies over the last 10 years.
There is a PDF file located in this repository that demonstrates a PowerPoint presentation that went along with this Excel file. The PowerPoint file was too large to upload.
There is a SQL script that was used to bring all of this Fortune 500 data together located here as well. All of this SQL was coded with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
There is a an IPYNB filed that breaks down the Fortune 500 into several different visualizations to examine using python.
Finally, there is a Power BI file, that presents a interactive dashboard with the Fortune 500 data.
